From child to senior, I never let my family worry about my study, because I am always learning actively. I personally prefer to make the things need to handle done and then do then play, so I can be more relaxed. To treat one thing, my principle is: if you are trying something you’re interest, you must pure your whole energy into it; take the post-graduate entrance examination, I chose this road myself, so I should treat it seriously. Finally, the results did not disappointment me, with first score to obtain post-graduate admission.

My interest in science dates back to my years in high school, where I excelled in physics, chemistry, and math. When I began my undergraduate career, I had the opportunity to be exposed to the full range of engineering courses, all of which tended to reinforce and solidify my intense interest in engineering. I've also had the opportunity to study a number of subjects in the humanities and they have been both enjoyable and enlightening, providing me with a new and different perspective on the world in which we live.

Presently, I study at a Nanjing University of Post and Telecommunications(NJUPT), a major higher-learning institution in telecommunication technologies in China. Engaged in cutting-edge research and development at this center, I have accumulated a lot of advanced knowledge and expertise in IT technologies in a relatively short time.

In the realm of engineering, I have developed a special interest in the field of Computer science. Management at this lab was sufficiently impressed with my work to ask that I return when I graduate. Of course, my plans following completion of my current studies are to move directly into graduate work toward my master's in science. After I earn my master's degree, I intend to start work on my Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Later I would like to work in the area of research and development for private industry. It is in R & D that I believe I can make the greatest contribution, utilizing my theoretical background and creativity as a scientist.

I obtained this coveted position at such a respected international establishment on the strength of my research experience at the North China Institute of Computing Technologies, the country's oldest research organization in computer science. Exercising my diligence and creativity, I specialized in automation research and development in this institute, which not only gave me the opportunity to make full use of what I had learned at the university but also spurred me to constantly improve myself. I taught myself Computer Control Technology, Contemporary Control Theory, Electrical control Technology and Process Control & Automation Device, among other subjects.

Because of my strong skills in both hardware and software, I served as the leader of ours team. Under my effective leadership, the team completed projects effectively. My research successes were built upon my solid postgraduate training at NJUPT, widely considered China's top engineering school. Between 2016 and 2019, I studied at NJUPT as a major of telecommunication engineering, concentrating on basic courses as well as courses of my major. These courses solidly grounded me in theories of telecommunications and endowed me with all-round expertise in both software and hardware engineering. At the time of my graduation, my overall GPA ranked me among the top 10% of about 200 students in my grade. 

Taking advantage of NJUPT’s emphasis on hands-on experience, I did a lot of lab work in my postgraduate studies. In my first year, I developed a MP3 player based on Arm. In this project I designed a novel memory management method which make my project execute more smoothly. In 2017, I independently designed a "Robot Control System". The successful development of this system enabled control more easily. In the course of these projects, I became versed in hardware structure of the RISC computer, UNIX operating system and programming. All this laid a firm foundation for my career advancement.

Ideally, I would like to enter into a Master's program that would lead me into Ph. D. studies later on. In such a program, I would like to focus my studies on one or a combination of the following areas: Control Systems, Communications Engineering, Digital Signal and Image Processing, or Microcomputer Applications. I will bring to the program a professional background significantly enrich my knowledge, enhance my expertise, and sharpen my research skills. If you accept me, you should find, some years down the road, that I will be a leading scientist in China's efforts to develop its IT industries.

I am highly aware of the superb reputation of your school, and my conversations with several of your alumni have served to deepen my interest in attending. I know that, in addition to your excellent faculty, your computer facilities are among the best in the state. I hope you will give me the privilege of continuing my studies at your fine institution.
